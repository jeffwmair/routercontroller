# Routercontroller

Simple java application used to send messages to my home router to adjust configuration settings.  Application is triggered from the file system, but anything could be a trigger (aka signal).

```shell
# compile & run tests
$ mvn compile test
# run from maven
$ mvn exec:java
```
